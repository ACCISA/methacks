# Nutriscan

NutriScan is a project we created to help people with dietary restrictions easily modify their favorite recipes to fit their specific needs. As a team that has collectively struggled with food sensitivities and allergies, we know firsthand how challenging it can be to find recipes that meet our dietary requirements while still being delicious and satisfying.

# InspirationðŸ’¡
Our inspiration for NutriScan came from our own experiences navigating dietary restrictions. We found ourselves constantly scouring recipe websites and books, only to be disappointed when we couldn't find anything that worked for us. We knew there had to be a better way to modify recipes to fit our needs, so we decided to create a tool that could do just that.

# What it Does ðŸ¤”
NutriScan is a web-based tool that allows users to upload an image or link to a recipe and receive a modified list of ingredients that follow their dietary restrictions. Users can select from a variety of dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, vegetarian, and vegan, among others.

# How We Built It ðŸ¦¾
To build NutriScan, we used Python and Flask to create the backend API, which communicated with a React frontend. We also integrated with various APIs, including the Spoonacular API for recipe data and the Tesseract OCR engine for image recognition. We used CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS and Flowbite to style the frontend and make it more user-friendly.

# Challenges We Ran Into ðŸ˜¤
One of the biggest challenges we faced in building NutriScan was linking React to the Python API. We had to figure out how to communicate between the two languages, which required a lot of experimentation and problem-solving. Additionally, integrating the Tesseract OCR engine for image recognition was a complex process that required a lot of testing and tweaking.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of âœ¨
We're proud of the fact that we were able to build a functional tool that can help people with dietary restrictions enjoy their favorite foods. We're also proud of the user-friendly interface we created, which makes it easy for people to use NutriScan without any technical knowledge.

# What We Learned ðŸ™Œ
In building NutriScan, we gained experience with a variety of technologies, including Python, Flask, React, and various APIs. We also learned how to use CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS and Flowbite to create a user-friendly frontend. Additionally, we gained a deeper understanding of how to link frontend and backend components to create a seamless user experience.

# What's Next for NutriScan ðŸš€
In the future, we plan to expand NutriScan's functionality to include more dietary restrictions and more advanced image recognition capabilities. We also plan to add more recipe data and improve the accuracy of our ingredient modification algorithms. Ultimately, our goal is to make NutriScan the go-to tool for people with dietary restrictions who want to enjoy delicious, satisfying meals without any worry or stress.
